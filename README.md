My solutions to Kattis problems. Solutions are named `"problemname".<languagefilename>`. To find the problem statement, please go to:

Problems are grouped by [NUS course](https://nus.kattis.com/courses) categorizations and a separate open category for non-NUS course problems. Some courses share several problems, you might be able to find them under any one of the categories. I generally use C++ unless the NUS course requires otherwise (language requirements found below). I switch to Python if I require big integer operations or if the solution is much shorter and simpler implementation-wise.

* NUS:

  * CS2040/CS2040C/CS2040DE/CS2040S/IT5003 Data Structures & Algorithms: C++ (CS2040C)/Java (CS2040, CS2040DE, CS2040S)/Python (IT5003)

  * CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms: C++/Java/Python

  * CS3233 Competitive Programming: C/C++/Java/Kotlin/Python

  * CS4234 Optimization Algorithms: C++/Java/Python

Kattis compiles using C++ 23 for [C++](https://open.kattis.com/languages/cpp), Java 21 for [Java](https://open.kattis.com/languages/java) and Python 3.10 for [Python](https://open.kattis.com/languages/python3).

Problems have to be solved using base programming language libraries or self-coded structures. External libraries, such as Boost for C++, Guava for Java, NumPy for Python 3 and others are not available. However, you are allowed to attach multiple files in one submission, although I never bothered.

Many of these solutions were implemented after reading the editorials, and I suggest you to do the same if you find yourself stuck. If you have any questions about a particular solution, please contact me at j_lim@u.nus.edu.
